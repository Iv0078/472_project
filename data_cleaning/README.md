# 472_project

## Description

The following project is created for COMP472 project 1, it allows the user to chart 25 images from the created datasets, followed by their histograms.

## How to run

Once you have download the code you will see that it contains 4 python executables: "data_check_test.py" , "data_check_training.py", "test_distribution" and "train_distribution". Running the first two will create a set of 25 images( chosen randomly from the data),followed by their histograms. It is important to keep in mind that the first code is for test images while the second one is for training images. The other two codes on the other hand will create a bar char with the respective number of images present for each dataset( test dataset, and train dataset).
